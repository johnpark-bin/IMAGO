He traveled to Silithus, recruiting a still-grieving Anduin Wrynn, and sought out the Speaker of Azeroth: Magni Bronzebeard. When he contacted the world soul directly, hoping to find out the meaning behind the cryptic visions, the strain of Azeroth's tormented outcries proved too much, and Magni fell into a coma.

Alongside Jaina Proudmoore, Thrall and Anduin took Magni to Dalaran, where the mages of the Kirin Tor could see to his recovery. His next of kin, namely his daughter Moira and grandson Dagran, arrived as well after hearing the news. Despite her strained relationship with his father, Moira still wished for his well-being, if only for her son's sake. Her wishes were answered, and Magni woke up, revealing the destination Azeroth had showed him: the distant island of Khaz Algar.

The recently returned Archmage Drenden tasked the Champion with realigning the defensive wards around the floating city before the teleport was performed. When they arrived, everyone but Alleria Windrunner was excited by the new wondrous lands that awaited them. She had received visions different from the Radiant Song, and found out that Drenden had been dead for years. Xal'atath had infiltrated the Kirin Tor and now summoned her nerubian allies through Dalaran's weakened wards.

Alleria, Anduin and the Champion immediately evacuated everybody they could while trying to fight off the endless swarms of nerubians. Meanwhile, Khadgar, leader of the Kirin Tor, confronted Xal'atath directly. He would defend Dalaran and the world with his life, and a fight ensued when he noticed the Void entity absorb the magical city's arcane energies. In a last-ditch effort, Khadgar teleported Alleria to safety and was engulfed in an enormous explosion that turned Dalaran into rubble.]],

Jaina Proudmoore and Thrall rallied the survivors but were ambushed by Queensguard Zirix. In their battered state, they would have struggled against the new onslaught, but help came unexpectedly in the form of Algarian Stormriders led by Stormward Baelgrim, who drove the nerubians into retreat. When the earthen natives saw Magni, they called him "thraegar" and showed him reverence.

Baelgrim invited the survivors to their capital, Dornogal, but the new allies had to fight side by side again when they saw the nerubians wreak havoc in the city. Although they beat the creatures back underground, the Coreway – a massive passage leading to the earthen settlements underground – collapsed in the attack. Jaina and Thrall knew their forces were outnumbered and left for the Eastern Kingdoms to call on reinforcements from the Horde and the Alliance.

Dagran befriended Machine Speaker Brinthe and was made aware of the slow collapse of the earthen people. Their titan-made machines, which kept them alive, were beginning to break down and with their creators gone for such a long time, many earthen had left the capital and their titan-given edicts behind to live a life of their own choosing. While repairs on the Coreway commenced, Moira Thaurissan declared that she would find the leader of these unbound earthen and bring her back to her people.

Moira, Baelgrim and the Champion found Adelgonn in Freywold Village. They helped her defend her people against the nerubians, who did not relent in the slightest. They evacuated the injured to Dornogal and helped out Alleria Windrunner on the way, who had engaged Queensguard Zirix to find out where Xal'atath had been hiding since the fall of Dalaran.

Adelgonn rejoined the Council of Dornogal and lent her workers to the restoration effort of the Coreway. Meanwhile, Baelgrim and the Champion uncovered treachery in the ranks of the Stormriders and took out the Void collaborators. They needed to take the fight to the nerubians, and together with Alleria, they lured Zirix into a trap at the Cinderbrew Meadery. Baelgrim heroically gave his life to end the threat.

Back in Dornogal, the united earthen people were finishing up repairs on the Coreway – the way forward was clear.

        loreBits     = [[Alongside Brinthe, Moira, Magni, and Dagran, the Champion descended into the Ringing Deeps through the Coreway. New trouble awaited them mere minutes after arriving at Ironhaul Station – the transport hub between Dornogal and the miners' city of Gundargaz. The Machine Speakers were suffering from nerubian and kobold attacks and strange, maddened earthen had been spotted as well. High Speaker Eirich dismissed these concerns, as a threat far greater occupied his time: the Awakening Machine, inactive for millennia due to neglect, which could awake the earthen in stasis and put an end to the civilization's decline.

The Champion and their allies split up in Gundargaz to solve the earthen's problems themselves. Together with Brinthe, the Champion evacuated the earthen workers north of town as a goblin incursion was underway. They found and freed Skitter, a kobold who had not been keen on supporting her new ruler, the feared Candle King. They joined forces, started a revolution, and managed to defeat the warmonger. The kobolds and earthen of Gundargaz made peace and even began mutual trade.

Dagran and his grandfather Magni, meanwhile, were investigating the dark rumors coming out of the small mining settlement of Taelloch. They found the town shrouded in an eerie fog and witnessed a distressed worker transform into a skardyn – an earthen corrupted and maddened by the Void. Magni risked his own life to keep Dagran safe in the fighting that ensued. He knew he could never fully mend the rift he had created between himself and his daughter, and he would be damned if he now lost his only grandson as well. With the Champion ensuring their survival, the trio uncovered that High Speaker Eirich was working with Xal'atath. He was indeed going to reawaken the slumbering earthen in the Machine, and he would reawaken them as skardyn.

Moira and Brinthe assembled the united forces of the Ringing Deeps and Dornogal above and all together they pushed through the High Speaker's loyalists. They came too late, however, as Eirich had already begun the tainted process of awakening and escaped through a Void portal. The innocent earthen seemed lost, but Magni, Speaker of Azeroth, reached out to the world soul and erupted into bright light that cleansed the corruption. When the light faded, Magni had turned into stone. Dagran broke out into tears and Moira realized that they had just lost their second chance to become a family again. Then the stone broke, and Magni burst forth as a dwarf of flesh and blood. Azeroth had let him go from her service and the three embraced.

The confused newly-awakened earthen glimmered in Azeroth's magic and decided to follow their own path in life.

        loreBits     = [[Anduin Wrynn had followed rumors of another civilization in Khaz Algar's depths, after overhearing the earthen of Dornogal calling him an "Arathi". He met up with the Champion and together, they found a massive, open cave illuminated by a crystal shining with the Light. Cathedrals and airships marked human influence and they discovered that the inhabitants of Hallowfall were from the unheard-of Arathi Empire – a name formerly reserved for the original human kingdom in the Eastern Kingdoms.

The Arathi were wary of outsiders, but a particularly friendly young paladin named Faerin Lothar took the two newcomers under her wing. Anduin and the Champion helped her push back an onslaught of nerubians at the Aegis Wall – the border to Queen Ansurek's kingdom of Azj-Kahet. Alleria Windrunner arrived and killed the nerubian leader, deciding the battle in favor of the Arathi. She was, unsurprisingly, pursuing the spidery creatures to find Xal'atath. Faerin, meanwhile, ignited the dawntower, to shield the settlement with the power of the Light.

It was in this moment, however, that the radiant crystal Beledar shifted into darkness. The whole of Hallowfall became hostile without the Light and creatures of Void and Shadow jumped at them from every corner. They rescued whomever they could as the Arathi civilians were attacked from all sides. Anduin almost broke down during the ordeal. His own Light had left him after what had happened in the Shadowlands, and seeing hope vanish here as well, proved almost too much for him.

Another massive surge of Void energy extinguished the Sacred Flames nearby. Faerin, Anduin and the Champion tracked it to a corrupted dawntower. The Order of the Night revealed itself – Arathi who had become hopeless against the insurmountable odds they had faced here each day, and had joined Xal'atath – and a fight ensued. They won and restored the dawntower. In that moment, Beledar shifted again and with the Light returning, so too did Anduin's hope.

Rejoined by Alleria Windrunner, the four comrades arrived in Mereldar, the Arathi's capital. There, they rallied General Steelstrike and once again came to blows against the combined forces of the Order of the Night, the nerubians, and the kobyss. Alleria managed to break the cult leader's magical shield and after a rousing speech from Faerin, the Arathi defeated their enemies. Deciding to no longer play defensively, the group boarded the Reckoning, and set course for Azj-Kahet.

Faerin, Alleria, and the Champion couldn't prevent a crash-landing and while the lamplighter rallied and saved as many of her people as she could, Alleria set off alone to search for Anduin. A mysterious woman calling herself a "haranir" saw the fighting from afar and decided to help the heroes in need.

While Faerin regrouped, the Champion traveled alongside the mysterious stranger for a while. She called herself Orweyna and had been investigating the Black Blood – a sinister substance that permeated Azj-Kahet and slowly drove those who touched it to madness. The two strangers split up at the sight of the City of Threads and the Champion was approached by a curious little spider carrying a scroll. They followed the tiny messenger to the Weaver's Lair and forged a cautious alliance with Widow Arak'nai, a powerful nerubian who openly defied Queen Ansurek.

The Champion was sent to Siegehold to gather information on Queen Ansurek's army. They rescued survivors captured during Dalaran's fall, briefly teamed up with Flynn Fairwind, and noticed a more humanoid-looking group of nerubians giving everybody orders. They met General Anub'azal, former military leader of Ansurek's army, who harbored a great hatred against these new nerubians, the so-called Ascended.

Back at the Weaver's Lair, the Champion was sent to the City of Threads to meet Arak'nai's contact, Queen Ansurek's closest advisor, Executor Nizrek. Unhappy with how the queen allied herself with the Void, Nizrek had used his influence to get a hold of Anduin Wrynn, who was alive and well in the nerubian's quarters. Alleria found them and they decided to pay witness to Queen Ansurek's speech that was taking place in the city at this time. Hidden carefully, Alleria grew furious as Ansurek declared that every nerubian would soon embrace the Void and ascend. Xal'atath was at her side, and the elven ranger loosened an arrow despite Anduin's orders not to. She missed and Queen Ansurek demanded the intruders' deaths.

The entire city was on their heels and while Anduin and the Champion jumped down a waterfall to their safety, Alleria stayed behind, determined to confront Xal'atath once and for all. She didn't even come close to defeating her enemy and the Harbinger tried to convince the ranger to embrace the Void and join her side. Alleria resisted but wasn't pursued when she finally fled as well. The three heroes returned to Dornogal while the Weaver cemented new alliances with the General and the Vizier to start a rebellion.

While the armies under Lord Commander Turalyon and Lady Liadrin established their embassies in Dornogal, Thrall and the Champion learned that the stormrooks of Dornogal had vanished and the earthen were left without means to train more Stormriders – their most accomplished warriors.

Thrall used his shamanistic knowledge to aid Stormward Lufsela, Baelgrim's successor, in communing with the elemental creatures and Kurdran Wildhammer gave the new recruits their first flying lessons – much to his old friend Turalyon's annoyance when electrified gryphons swooped low over his army. Soon after, the earthen of Dornogal declared themselves unbound, allowing everyone to choose to follow the Titan's edicts or reject them altogether. In immediate response, a massive titanic guardian rose from the ocean to wipe out the disobedient earthen. The new Stormriders were aided by Alleria, Jaina, and the Champion and managed to destroy the construct.

Meanwhile in Azj-Kahet, Lillian Voss, the Champion and Y'tekhi followed the Weaver's new lead into Ansurek's Grand Splicer's laboratory. They discovered that the first Ascended nerubian was none other than Ansurek's mother who had been thought dead – Queen Neferess. She had mutated into a monster through forced experimentation. Xal'atath found them and controlled Y'tekhi to fight their allies. Lillian subdued her and the three escaped. The Champion then traveled to the Ringing Deeps, where they aided Dagran II and Brinthe to restore ancient battle golems to aid them in the fight ahead.

The time for the final battle was at hand and when Xal'atath's army launched an assault on the Aegis Wall in Hallowfall, the armies of Dornogal quickly joined the defending Arathi. Queen Neferess, among the attacking nerubians, briefly regained her consciousness and was rescued. Amidst the fighting, Alleria suddenly heard Khadgar's voice and realized that this swarm of nerubians was merely a diversion. Together with Anduin Wrynn, she confronted the Harbinger in the Priory of the Sacred Flame, damaged the Dark Heart, and forced Xal'atath to retreat. Khadgar was freed but so weakened by the ordeal that he took his last breath in Alleria's arms. In that moment, Beledar returned to the Light and Anduin found hope in himself again. He called on the Light and saved Khadgar from the brink of death.

The Weaver and the Vizier meanwhile put a stop to Queen Ansurek and successfully completed their rebellion. Ansurek died in her palace, forsaken by the very Harbinger she had devoted herself to. Xal'atath merely mocked her fallen ally for failing to withstand the outsiders.

A new song had lured them all to the small island and its source lay in its center: A giant humming crystal much like Beledar that extended for miles underground. The Arathi named it "Lorandel" and claimed it as holy, while the earthen wanted to study its properties. The goblins, naturally, sought to gain profit and the groups had difficulties working together.

The Champion, meanwhile, found ruins of a Kul Tiran mining operation, yet there was no human to be found. They recovered records claiming the island was haunted and the frequent, almost unnatural storms gave that assessment credence. An old vrykul vault hid singing tablets and the Champion found evidence of an entity called "Cyrce" who used to reside on the island. Weeks of further research yielded no new finds. The secrets of the Siren Isle remained buried deep for the time being.

On the shores of Khaz Algar, Archmage Aethas Sunreaver was desperately defending what little remained of Dalaran, in spite of his own dwindling health. The other mages of the Kirin Tor, while they had given up on Dalaran, could not stand to see their friend and comrade suffer and offered to aid him. Kalecgos recovered magical artifacts that were stolen by kobolds after the crash, and had to free himself from a pocket dimension inside a necklace left behind by Kel'Thuzad. Jaina Proudmoore destroyed dangerous artifacts the nerubians had taken from the magical floating city, including an arcane mana bomb. Afterwards, the surviving members of the Kirin Tor came together to honor their fallen brothers and sisters and accepted that Dalaran's age had come to an end.

Meanwhile in Hallowfall, Orweyna and her haranir were still investigating the Black Blood, yet when the Champion found them, Orweyna's companions left her to continue alone. Haranir, they said, were not supposed to talk to outsiders and they couldn't follow their friend's visions any longer. Orweyna understood, yet her goddess' voice beckoned her to continue. She saw machines drilling through rocks and the Champion led her toward Opportunity Point in the Ringing Deeps.

They teamed up with Monte Gazlowe and Renzik "the Shiv", who were investigating the goblins of the Opportunity Acquisitions for information about Undermine. Together with Orweyna, the team searched the mining facilities and uncovered who the leader of this operation truly was: Jastor Gallywix, Gazlowe's predecessor as Trade Prince of the Bilgewater Cartel, and persona non grata for both Horde and Alliance. With their investigation at an end for now, the group returned to Dornogal. Reluctantly, Orweyna accompanied them and began acquainting herself with her new allies.]],

        loreBits = [[The way to Undermine was blasted open suddenly, when the cave walls of the Ringing Deeps near Opportunity Point were blown up from the inside. Gazlowe, Renzik, Orweyna, and the Champion uncovered a sprawling excavation site where goblins toiled under horrific conditions, driven to madness by exposure to the Black Blood. They dismantled as much as they could of the operation and teamed up with Grimla Fizzlecrank and Pamsy of the Venture Co. to gain access into Undermine. Gazlowe was reluctant to return to his former home but knew that Gallywix couldn't be trusted with the Black Blood.

Gazlowe, being Trade Prince of the Bilgewater Cartel, had left Laslo Overbite as his representative in the Undermine and was distraught when he heard of his demise at Gallywix's hands. The trail of the Black Blood led them to Baron Revilgaz and Gazlowe's friend Marin Noggenfogger who both seemed to comply with Gallywix's orders. When they suspected Ethereal involvement, they contacted Alleria Windrunner. While Gazlowe was getting ever more disillusioned by the state of his former home, Renzik was adamant that they needed to change things down here, regardless of what their investigation would bring up. The SI:7 agent had left this town years ago, but wanted to finally make a difference and not run away anymore.

Noggenfogger finally revealed the truth: Gallywix was fashioning powerful weapons infused with the Black Blood in exchange for repairing the Dark Heart for Xal'atath. To do that he had needed the other cartels' help and was still holding Noggenfogger's wife captive to force him to cooperate. In that moment, the entire group was ambushed by Shadowguard ethereals who had overheard them. They chased them but because they freed the hostages, the k'areshi found Gallywix first. With the completed Dark Heart in hand, they vanished once more. Since the ethereals certainly worked for Xal'atath, Alleria left the group to once more hunt the Harbinger, and Gazlowe was prepared to turn his back to the city as well.

Just as Renzik tried to convince him to stay, a single red targeting dot appeared on Gazlowe's chest. Without hesitation, Renzik threw himself between the bullet and his fellow goblin, sacrificing his own life. Gallywix had ordered his manic sharpshooter, Nikki the Fixer, to take out his rival, but it was only with Renzik's death, that Gazlowe finally decided to fight for Undermine. Soon, the entirety of its fed-up and exploited citizens marched towards the Gallagio.

Gallywix, retreating into his palace as he saw the angry mob, was relieved when Xal'atath arrived. She revealed that the ethereals had acted on their own and that the Dark Heart was now beyond her reach. She abandoned her ally, and former Trade Prince Jastor Gallywix perished soon after, buried under his own machines.

Gazlowe decided to stay in the Undermine, at least for a while longer. After scattering Renzik's ashes alongside with SI:7 leader Mathias Shaw – Renzik's only real friend – he formed a new ruling council together with Noggenfogger, Revilgaz and Grimla and vowed to change how things would be down here.

Outposts of the Horde and the Alliance had been raided and the capital needed its king. The Champion and Faerin Lothar, eager to visit her people's ancestral homeland, joined them.

When they arrived at Newstead, they found the peaceful farmstead overrun by a group of bandits calling themselves "the Red Dawn". After ensuring Newstead was secured once more, Faerin and the Champion went to confront Colonel Veronica Nials, left in charge of Stromgarde before Danath had left, while the king headed towards Hammerfall. A foul mood reigned in the city and with shortages of food and paranoia due to the strong Horde presence nearby, civil unrest hung in the air. Marran Trollbane, Danath's niece and former regent of Stromgarde, still inspired much support even from behind prison bars and sowed dissent towards everyone who wasn't human.

The Champion and Faerin knew they needed to inform Danath of his niece's apparent involvement and found more evidence of the Red Dawn's destructiveness on their way. Danath, as it turned out, had never arrived in Hammerfall. The Champion and Faerin distributed rations to the human refugees from the surrounding farmlands, while Eitrigg sent out armed outriders to search for the king. Without these warriors, however, Hammerfall's defenses were weakened significantly. The human refugees revealed themselves as Red Dawn and set Hammerfall to the torch. Even though they were defeated, the orcish stronghold suffered great losses and the Arathi Highlands were poised to become the stage of a new war.

The outriders returned with grave news: Danath had been kidnapped and evidence had been planted by the Red Dawn to frame the Horde. The group had to act fast and while Faerin rushed back to Stromgarde, Eitrigg and Geya'rah led a skirmish to the abandoned Horde war fortress of Ar'gorok, where they found and rescued the king.

Returning to the capital, they discovered that Colonel Nials had turned traitor, freed Marran and started a coup. Faerin engaged Danath's niece in a duel and proved superior. Defeated, the former regent said that Danath had put his own people second time and again to play hero and to fraternize with the Horde. Faerin was unmoved, but Danath forbade the killing blow and decided to send his niece and her followers into exile and stripped her of her title and name.

Faerin was glad to have made a difference in the land she had heard so much about as a child, but was left pensive and disillusioned after seeing what had become of it.]],

        loreBits = [[Alleria's mentor, Locus-Walker, had managed to track down the Dark Heart on the ethereal's devastated homeworld of K'aresh. The Shadowguard were using its power to return Dimensius – the void lord who destroyed the planet so many millennia ago - to full strength.

Locus-Walker teleported Alleria and the Champion to Tazavesh, the broker city built by the ethereals from the Shadowlands, to find refuge after K'aresh's fall. Now it was floating in the skies of the remains of the broken world. Apart from the brokers, Locus-Walker spoke of another ally he had made, someone who had warned him of an impending attack of the Shadowguard. Indeed, the flying city was soon besieged by their void-wielding foes but Alleria and the Champion were experienced enough by now to repel their attackers without much difficulty.

Owing their quick victory to Locus-Walker's new ally, Alleria's confidence turned into anger when her mentor introduced them. It turned out he was working alongside the Harbinger herself, Xal'atath. The being of the Void convinced her pursuer that without her, the heroes of Azeroth and K'aresh would stand no chance against a void lord and the universe would suffer as a result. Alleria, attuned to the forces of the Void, already felt Dimensius stirring, and had to admit Xal'atath was needed in this battle.

The Harbinger showed the Champion and Windrunner how to transmute into energy to withstand Dimensius' devouring presence through the use of so-called Reshii ribbons. They were incredibly rare and only a few remained on the shattered world below them. To obtain them, they aided Ve'nari in her ambitious attempt to restore life on K'aresh and Xal'atath used her usual silver tongue to ally with the Wastelanders - ethereals sworn to Nexus-King Salhadaar. The Harbinger convinced Soul-Scribe, leader of the Wastelanders, that the world-soul of K'aresh still remained alive and thus, the group obtained an army.

Dissent was sown in the fragile alliance, however, when Xal'atath revealed that it hadn't been Dimensius who destroyed K'aresh, but none other than Locus-Walker himself. In an attempt to kill the void lord, he had sacrificed his world and people and Alleria's trust in her mentor was shattered.

Nevertheless, the group stormed Manaforge: Omega and put an end to the Shadowguard ethereals, including Salhadaar. It took everyone's power combined to take a stand against the still-weakened Dimensius and without Xal'atath's interventions, the Champion would have perished then and there. Finally, they managed to trap the void lord inside the Dark Heart and Xal'atath stayed behind while the others escaped. It was, however, a ruse. With a fully-empowered Dark Heart, Xal'atath re-emerged, killed Locus-Walker, and left Alleria and the Champion behind to mourn and realize their defeat.

Yet a glimmer of hope remained after everything. To everyone's surprise, Xal'atath hadn't lied about K'aresh's fate. Soul-Scribe gave her life to renew the world-soul and Ve'nari vowed to protect it. The ethereals' world was broken and shattered, but it was still alive.

His aunt Vereesa had been plagued by ominous visions, and the young paladin didn't know how to help her anymore. They met Vereesa amidst the ruins of Dalaran and while she mourned the city – the last reminder of her late husband Rhonin – a new vision triggered. She saw Silvermoon consumed by the Void, its paladin defenders burned alive, Lor'themar, the Champion, and her sister Alleria swallowed by a terrible darkness, and a maniacal Magister Umbric killing Grand Magister Rommath.

As if to prove her visions right, members of the Twilight's Hammer cult – now followers of Xal'atath and calling themselves the Twilight's Blade – ambushed the three. Even though they defeated the cultists, Arator knew that Silvermoon would soon become besieged by the Void. Alongside the Champion he set out to Tazavesh to find his mother. Magister Umbric told them where to find Alleria and the void elf vowed to return to his homeland as well to help defend it at all costs.

Arator's mother was, unsurprisingly, on the hunt. Xal'atath still had the Dark Heart and Alleria used Ve'nari's help to trap and interrogate the Harbinger's remaining forces on K'aresh to find out where she was hiding. She refused Arator's request to return to Silvermoon with him.

The young paladin didn't give up yet, however. Another Windrunner remained who had defended Silvermoon once before: Sylvanas, the Banshee Queen, former Ranger-General of Quel'Thalas. With Ve'nari's help, Arator traveled to the Maw and the Champion found themselves back in the hellscape where they had begun their journey through the Shadowlands years ago.

They found Sylvanas continuing her long journey toward redemption. She sought out and protected the souls of the people she had damned to this hell and slowly but surely, she was sending them all to the afterlives they truly deserved. Her penance was not done and Sylvanas, just like Alleria, refused Arator's request. If Silvermoon needed a Windrunner to defend her, Sylvanas urged Arator to be a Windrunner himself and fight for their family's ancestral home. Alongside the Champion, Arator returned to Dornogal empty-handed but renewed in purpose.

Meanwhile, Alleria Windrunner managed to find Xal'atath. Following her enemy through a void portal, she witnessed the Harbinger drain the Dark Heart of all its power.
